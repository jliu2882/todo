Hey, this is my first non-school project :D
I thought I would make something that I could use everyday
This program was built mostly to help me make some good habits(making it run on startup was a bit tricky but I got it)
The code is messy but I tried my best >:(

Figured I should put how I get this to run everyday so I don't forget about it! 
I built the project in IntelliJ and got a .jar
I then wrote a batch file which runs it once I click the shortcut.
Finally, I used Task Scheduler on Windows to run the shortcut on startup.
